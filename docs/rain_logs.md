## rain logs

Show the event log for the named stack

### Synopsis

Shows a nicely-formatted list of the event log for the named stack, optionally limiting the results to a single resource.

By default, rain will only show log entries that contain a message, for example a failure reason. You can use flags to change this behaviour.

```
rain logs <stack> (<resource>)
```

### Options

```
  -a, --all    Include uninteresting logs
  -h, --help   help for logs
  -l, --long   Display full details
  -t, --time   Show results in order of time instead of grouped by resource
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --debug            Output debugging information
  -p, --profile string   AWS profile name; read from the AWS CLI configuration file
  -r, --region string    AWS region to use
```
